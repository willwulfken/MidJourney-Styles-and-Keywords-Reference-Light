<h2>Why is it Called "Light"?</h2>

<b>This version of the repo was designed to load quicker and use less data</b> for slow connections and those which have a data usage limit.

This repo itself is <b>about 15% the size</b> of <a href="https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference">MidJourney Styles and Keywords Reference</a>.

<b>However, there are some drawbacks.</b> Some of the images have been cropped to one MidJourney result and some have been scaled down to half the size. The GUI is also replaced with a text based GUI and though it doesn't look as good, further improves loading times and reduces data usage.

Other than this, most if not all of the images have been converted to webp, which save some data but have the same quality as their png counterparts. Webp isn't quite as widely supported as png, mostly for old platforms, but most people won't have an issue.
